Registration
============

In order to register for the competition and be eligible, at least one member of the team must sign up using the form at `<https://bit.ly/ariac2023>`_

Multiple members of the team may fill out the form if desired as this will also be used for creating the mailing list for information on the competition as it is released.

Once the final version of the rules has been approved and posted on the challenge.gov site, a team wishing to be prize eligible will need to follow the updated instructions and fill out the form again at that time. An email will be sent and the `ARIAC website <https://www.nist.gov/ariac>`_ will be updated at this time.
