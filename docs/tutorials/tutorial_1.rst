  - **Source Code**: `https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC_tutorials <https://github.com/usnistgov/ARIAC_tutorials>`_

This tutorial details the steps necessary to start the competition from a competitor package.

------------------------
Starting the enviornment
------------------------

To start the enviornment, use this command:

.. code-block:: bash
        
            ros2 launch ariac_gazebo ariac.launch.py competitor_pkg:=ariac_tutorials trial_name:=tutorial dev_mode:=True

------------------
Running tutorial 1
------------------

To start tutorial 1, open a new terminal and use this command:

.. code-block:: bash
        
            ros2 launch ariac_tutorials tutorial.launch.py tutorial:=1

-----------------------------
Expected output of tutorial 1

Code explaination

This is the node used for tutorial 1. The functions from competition_interface.py which are used are highlighted.

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import rclpy
    import threading
    from rclpy.executors import MultiThreadedExecutor
    from ariac_tutorials.competition_interface import CompetitionInterface
    from ariac_msgs.msg import CompetitionState

    def main(args=None):
        rclpy.init(args=args)
        interface = CompetitionInterface(enable_moveit=False)

        executor = MultiThreadedExecutor()
        executor.add_node(interface)

        spin_thread = threading.Thread(target=executor.spin)
        spin_thread.start()

        interface.start_competition()

        while not interface.get_competition_state == CompetitionState.ORDER_ANNOUNCEMENTS_DONE:
            pass
        
        interface.end_competition()
        spin_thread.join()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

First, an instance of the :python:`CompetitionInterface` is created with :python:`enable_moveit` set to :python:`False`, as moveit_py is not needed for this tutorial.
Then, an executor is created containing an instance of :python:`CompetitionInterface`. After this, a thread is created to spin the executor.
The competition is then started using the :python:`start_competition` method in :python:`CompetitionInterface`. This uses the `/ariac/start_competition` service to start the competition.
The node then waits until the competition state is `ORDER_ANNOUNCEMENTS_DONE`. Finally, the competition is ended using the `/ariac/end_competition` service and the thread is joined with the main thread.
