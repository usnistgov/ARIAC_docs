==========
Evaluation
==========

The scoring for ARIAC 2025 will be divided into three major sections:

.. container::

    1. **Base Score**: How well was the assigned task completed?
    2. **Bonus Score**: Various factors; how efficient and accurate is the created system?
    3. **Penalties**: Various sources; how often did the competitor perform an illegal action?

----------
Base Score
----------

.. Split into kitting score and module score

The base score for the competition stems from the completion of tasks assigned in the run.
The base score can is comprised of the the kitting score and the module score.

**Base Score**

.. container::

  .. math::

    K = \omega_1 \cdot \frac{k_c}{k_d} + \omega_2 \cdot \frac{m_c}{m_d}

Where: 

.. container::

    * B = the base score for the run
    * :math:`\omega_1` = the weight associated with kit completion. The static value of :math:`ω_1` is 500
    * :math:`k_c` = number of kits successfully completed 
    * :math:`k_d` = number of kits requested
    * :math:`\omega_2` = the weight associated with module completion. The static value of :math:`ω_2` is 800
    * :math:`m_c` = number of modules successfully completed 
    * :math:`m_d` = number of modules requested


------------
Bonus Points
------------

ARIAC 2025 allows competitors to acquire bonus points from a variety of sources. 
These sources include the following:

**Trial Time**

The trial time bonus is awarded for successfully completing the competition in less time than alloted.

.. container:: 

  .. math::

    \beta_1 = \omega_3 \cdot (1 - \frac{t_e}{t_m})

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`\beta_1` = the total bonus for trial time. 
    * :math:`\omega_3` = the weight associated with the trial time bonus. The static value of :math:`ω_3` is 175
    * :math:`t_e` = run execution duration
    * :math:`t_m` = run time limit

**Inspection Speed**

The inspection speed bonus is awarded for submitting the inspection report in less time than needed.

.. container::

  .. math::

    \beta_2 = max [ 0 , \omega_4 \cdot (1 - \frac{\gamma}{\gamma_d})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`\beta_2` = the total bonus for inspection speed
    * :math:`\omega_4` = the weight associated with the inspection speed bonus. The static value of :math:`ω_4` is 125
    * :math:`\gamma` = average inspection duration
    * :math:`\gamma_d` = desired inspection duration. The desired inspection time is 8 seconds.

**High Priority Order Speed**

The high priority order speed bonus is awarded for successfully completing high priority orders faster than the high priority time limit.

.. container::

  .. math::

    \beta_3 = max [ 0 , \omega_5 \cdot (1 - \frac{\tau}{\tau_d})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`\beta_3` = the total bonus for high priority order speed
    * :math:`\omega_5` = the weight associated with the high priority order speed bonus. The static value of :math:`ω_5` is 150
    * :math:`\tau` = average high priority kit execution duration
    * :math:`\tau_d` = desired high priority kit execution duration. The desired completion time is 130 seconds.

**Sensor Cost**

The sensor cost bonus is awarded for minimizing the cost of sensors competitors use to complete the competition. Going over budget results instead in a penalty.

.. container::

  .. math::

    \beta_4 = max [ 0 , \omega_6 \cdot (1 - \frac{\sigma}{\sigma_b})]

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`\beta_4` = the total bonus for sensor cost
    * :math:`\omega_6` = the weight associated with the sensor cost bonus. The static value of :math:`ω_6` is 500
    * :math:`\sigma` = competitor sensor cost
    * :math:`\sigma_b` = sensor budget. The sensor budget is set at $7000

**Inspection Classification**

The inspection classification bonus is awarded for correctly identifying the defect type and location. All elements of the defect report must be correct for a report to be considered
correct.

.. container::

  .. math::

    \beta_5 = \omega_7 \cdot (1 - \frac{\nu}{\delta})

Where:

.. container::

    * :math:`\beta_5` = the total bonus for inspection classification
    * :math:`\omega_7` = the weight associated with the inspecton classification bonus. The static value of :math:`ω_7` is 100
    * :math:`\nu` = number of correctly classified reports
    * :math:`\delta` = total number of defective cells

------------
Penalties
------------

ARIAC 2025 incorporates penalties for certain events that occur during the competition.
All penalties are calculated per occurance, meaning that each penalty has an associated value, and each time
a penalty is recorded, that value will be deducted from the total score. The penalties come from the following sources:

* Non-defective cell is pushed into inspection bin
* Cell falls into conveyor bin
* Cell comes into contact with an invalid surface
* Two AGVs collide
* A robot collides, either with an object in the environment, or another robot
* The sensor cost used is over the provided budget

The following table shows the symbols for each penalty and their associated values.

================= =============================================== ======
Penalty Symbols   Description                                     Value
================= =============================================== ======
:math:`\rho_{0}`     Non-defective cell in inspection bin            20
:math:`\rho_{1}`     Cell in conveyor bin                            20
:math:`\rho_{2}`     Object on invalid surface                       20
:math:`\rho_{3}`     AGV collision                                   40
:math:`\rho_{4}`     Robot collision                                 50
:math:`\rho_{5}`     Sensor cost over budget                         0.0715
================= =============================================== ======

.. admonition:: Robot Collision Note
  :class: note
  :name: robot-collision

  For the robot collision, for every 5 seconds the robot is in collision, another occurance of the penalty will be recorded.
  In addition, if a robot is in collision with another robot, this penalty will be counted twice.

.. admonition:: Sensor Cost Note
  :class: note
  :name: sensor-over-budget

  For the sensor cost penalty, the penalty is calculated for each dollar over the provided budget. Using less than the provided
  budget will result in a bonus being applied to the score.

-----------
Total Score
-----------

In order to calculate the entire run score, the following formula can be used, combining the previous calculations:

.. container::

  .. math::

    R = K + M + \sum \beta_i - \sum \rho_i * o_i

Where:

.. container::

    * R = the total run score
    * K = the kit score for the run
    * M = the module score for the run
    * :math:`\beta_i` = the bonus scores
    * :math:`\rho_i` = the deduction for each penalty type
    * :math:`o_i` = the number of occurances for the associated penalty
