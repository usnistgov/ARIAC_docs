==========
ARIAC 2025
==========

The `Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC) <https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition>`_, put on by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is an annual competition that tests the ability of robots to perform a series of tasks in a dynamic environment. The tasks are designed to test the robot's ability to perform pick-and-place operations, assembly, and kitting in a simulated warehouse. Agility in the context of ARIAC isn't just about a robot's physical capabilities or speed; it's about how adaptable, efficient, and autonomous it can be in a dynamic manufacturing environment. The competition serves as a testbed for developing algorithms that can be applied in real-world manufacturing settings. NIST uses the insights gained from the contest to shape standard metrics and test methods for future robotic agility in manufacturing.
