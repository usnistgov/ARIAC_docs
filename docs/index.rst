ARIAC 2025 Documentation
=========================

Welcome to **ARIAC 2025!**

The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC), put on by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is an annual robotics competition that tests the ability of robots to perform complex manufacturing tasks in a dynamic environment. ARIAC 2025 focuses specifically on **agility in manufacturing** through tasks involving perception, task planning, motion planning, and reasoning with emphasis on adaptability, autonomy, and efficiency.

The competition serves as a testbed for developing algorithms that can be applied in real-world manufacturing settings, with results guiding standards efforts in robot agility. NIST uses the insights gained from the contest to shape standard metrics and test methods for future robotic agility in manufacturing.
